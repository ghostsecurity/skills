# Vulnerability Class Reference

## Authorization Flaws (BFLA/BOLA/IDOR)

Look for:
- Missing ownership checks in database queries (e.g., no `UserId` in WHERE clause)
- Inconsistent authorization between similar operations (e.g., destination checked but source not checked)
- Direct object references without access control
- Horizontal privilege escalation (accessing other users' resources)
- Vertical privilege escalation (accessing admin functions)

## Injection (SQLi/XSS/Command Injection)

Look for:
- Unsanitized user input in queries, templates, or system commands
- Missing parameterized queries or prepared statements
- Reflected or stored user input without encoding

## Authentication Flaws

Look for:
- Missing authentication middleware on protected routes
- Bypassable auth checks (e.g., checking only one of multiple auth paths)
- Session management issues
