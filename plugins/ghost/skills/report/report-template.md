# Security Report

## Scan Information
- **Repository**: <repo_name>
- **Commit**: <short_sha>
- **Date**: <date>
- **Scans Included**: <list of scan types that ran, e.g., deps, secrets, code>

---

## Executive Summary

<1-2 paragraphs summarizing:
- Overall security posture of the repository
- Count of high-confidence findings by severity (high, medium)
- Which scan types contributed findings
- Business context from repo.md if available (criticality level, sensitive data types at risk)
- Key areas of concern and recommended immediate actions>

---

## Critical & High Findings

<For each high-severity, high-confidence finding, inline the full substantive content grouped by finding type as shown below. Findings from different scan types sit together under this heading, sorted by type (deps → secrets → code).>

### SCA findings — include:

#### <Title>

- **Severity**: High
- **Package**: <package@version>
- **Lockfile**: <lockfile path>
- **CVEs**: <CVE identifiers>

**Vulnerability Summary**

<2-4 sentences describing the vulnerability>

**Exploitability Analysis**

<Usage context, vulnerable functions called, attack vector (entry point, data flow, impact)>

| Factor | Assessment | Evidence |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| <factor> | <assessment> | <evidence> |

**Remediation**

- Upgrade command: `<command>`
- Target version: <version>
- Test areas: <areas to test after upgrade>

**Vulnerable Code**

```
<vulnerable code snippet>
```

---

### Secret findings — include:

#### <Title>

- **Severity**: High
- **Location**: <file:line>
- **Secret Type**: <type>

**Description**

<2-4 sentences describing the finding>

**Secret Details**

- Redacted Value: <redacted>
- Type: <type>
- Entropy: <entropy score>

**Code Context**

```
<code context snippet>
```

**Risk Assessment**

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|-----------|
| Real Secret | <yes/no + evidence> |
| Hardcoded | <yes/no + evidence> |
| Production Code Path | <yes/no + evidence> |
| Exposure Evidence | <details> |

**Remediation**

1. Rotate the credential immediately
2. Remove from source code
3. Scrub from git history
4. Audit access logs

---

### Code findings — include:

#### <Title>

- **Severity**: High
- **CWE**: <CWE identifier>
- **Location**: <file:line:function>

**Description**

<2-4 sentences describing the vulnerability>

**Vulnerable Code**

```
<vulnerable code snippet>
```

**Remediation**

<Remediation guidance>

**Fixed Code**

```
<fixed code snippet>
```

**Verification**: <verdict> — <reason>

---

<If no high-severity findings exist, write:>

No critical or high severity findings were identified across all scans.

---

## Medium Findings

<For each medium-severity finding, write a full subsection using the same per-type structure as Critical & High above. Each finding gets its own subsection — do NOT use a condensed table. Include description, location, code context, and remediation for every finding.>

<If no medium-severity findings exist, write:>

No medium severity findings were identified across all scans.

## Scan Coverage

| Scan Type | Status | Candidates Scanned | Confirmed Findings | False Positives Filtered |
|-----------|--------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------------|
| Dependencies (SCA) | <ran / not run> | <count> | <count> | <count> |
| Secrets | <ran / not run> | <count> | <count> | <count> |
| Code (SAST) | <ran / not run> | <count> | <count> | <count> |

### Methodology

<For each scan type that ran, include a 1-2 sentence methodology note drawn from the per-scan reports. For example:>

- **Dependencies (SCA)**: <brief methodology note>
- **Secrets**: <brief methodology note>
- **Code (SAST)**: <brief methodology note>
