description: This skill should be used when the user asks to "start the proxy", "capture traffic", "intercept requests", "inspect HTTP traffic", "search captured requests", "view request/response", or needs to use the reaper MITM proxy to observe or test live web application traffic. Used in conjunction with the validate skill to confirm security vulnerabilities through live testing.

# Reaper MITM Proxy

Reaper is a CLI-based MITM HTTPS proxy for application security testing. It intercepts, logs, and allows inspection of HTTP/HTTPS traffic flowing through it. Use it to capture live request/response pairs for security validation.

## Quick Reference

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `reaper start --domains example.com` | Start proxy (foreground) |
| `reaper start --domains example.com -d` | Start proxy (daemon) |
| `reaper logs` | Show recent captured entries |
| `reaper search --method POST --path /api/*` | Search captured traffic |
| `reaper get <id>` | Show full request + response |
| `reaper req <id>` | Show raw HTTP request only |
| `reaper res <id>` | Show raw HTTP response only |
| `reaper stop` | Stop the daemon |

## Starting the Proxy

Start reaper scoped to the target domain(s). At least one `--domains` or `--hosts` flag is required.

```bash
# Intercept all traffic to example.com and its subdomains
reaper start --domains example.com

# Multiple domains
reaper start --domains example.com,api.internal.co

# Exact hostname matching
reaper start --hosts api.example.com

# Both domain suffix and exact host matching
reaper start --domains example.com --hosts special.internal.co

# Custom port (default: 8443)
reaper start --domains example.com --port 9090

# Run as background daemon
reaper start --domains example.com -d
```

**Scope behavior**:
- `--domains`: Suffix match. `example.com` matches `example.com`, `api.example.com`, `sub.api.example.com`
- `--hosts`: Exact match. `api.example.com` matches only `api.example.com`
- Traffic outside scope passes through transparently without logging

## Routing Traffic Through the Proxy

Configure the HTTP client to use the proxy. The default listen address is `localhost:8443`.

```bash
# curl
curl -x http://localhost:8443 -k https://api.example.com/endpoint

# Environment variables (works with many tools)
export http_proxy=http://localhost:8443
export https_proxy=http://localhost:8443

# Python requests
import requests
requests.get("https://api.example.com/endpoint",
             proxies={"http": "http://localhost:8443", "https": "http://localhost:8443"},
             verify=False)
```

The `-k` / `verify=False` flag is needed because reaper generates its own CA certificate at startup for MITM TLS interception.

## Viewing Captured Traffic

### Recent Entries

```bash
# Show last 50 entries (default)
reaper logs

# Show last 200 entries
reaper logs -n 200
```

Output columns: `ID`, `METHOD`, `HOST`, `PATH`, `STATUS`, `MS`, `REQ` (request body size), `RES` (response body size).

### Searching

```bash
# By HTTP method
reaper search --method POST

# By host (supports * wildcard)
reaper search --host *.api.example.com

# By domain suffix
reaper search --domains example.com

# By path prefix (supports * wildcard)
reaper search --path /api/v3/transfer

# By status code
reaper search --status 200

# Combined filters
reaper search --method POST --path /api/v3/* --status 200 -n 50
```

### Inspecting Individual Entries

```bash
# Full request and response (raw HTTP)
reaper get 42

# Request only
reaper req 42

# Response only
reaper res 42
```

Output is raw HTTP/1.1 format including headers and body, suitable for analysis or replay.

## Stopping the Proxy

```bash
reaper stop
```

## Common Workflows

### Validate a Security Finding

When used with the `validate` skill (may need to collaborate with the user to setup the test environment):

1. Start reaper scoped to the application domain
2. Authenticate (or ask the user to authenticate) as a normal user and exercise the vulnerable endpoint legitimately
3. Search for the captured request to understand the expected request format
4. Craft and send a malicious request that exercises the exploit described in the finding
5. Inspect the response to determine if the exploit succeeded
6. Use `reaper get <id>` to capture the full request/response as evidence

## Data Storage

All data is stored in `~/.reaper/`:
- `reaper.db` - SQLite database with captured entries
- `reaper.sock` - Unix socket for CLI-to-daemon IPC
- `reaper.pid` - Daemon process ID

The CA certificate is generated fresh in memory on each start and is not persisted.
