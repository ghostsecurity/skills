## Finding Details

For detailed information about each finding, see the individual finding files in:
`<scan_dir>/findings/`

## Methodology

This scan was performed using:
1. **Poltergeist Scanner**: Fast regex-based secret detection with 100+ built-in rules
2. **AI Analysis**: Each candidate was analyzed by an AI agent to filter false positives
3. **Context Evaluation**: Candidates in test code or using environment variables were filtered

### Analysis Criteria
- Real secret vs placeholder detection
- Hardcoded vs environment-loaded values
- Production vs test code paths
- Evidence of exposure in version control
